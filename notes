An element of the list could have one move:
{move: 'b4' comments: []}

or multiple moves:
{move: 'Bc5' ravs:[
              {moves: [], comments:[], result: []}
              {moves: [], comments:[], result: []}
]}

* In the above case Bc5 is the main move. To access other variations
We use ["ravs"][j]["moves"]
